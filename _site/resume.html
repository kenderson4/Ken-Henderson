          <div class="list_more_link">+ Show/Hide Details</div>          
          <div class="list_more">The typical architecture of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) contains a layer called the microporous sublayer (MSL). The MSL is a mixture of carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is typically applied to the gas diffusion layer (GDL). The composition (wt.% PTFE) and loading (mg/cm2) can be varied to optimize the electrochemical performance of the PEMFC and the overall adhesion of the layers within the PEMFC. This research establishes correlations that characterize the performance and adhesion of the layers within the PEMFC based on composition, loading, fabrication pressure, and fabrication time. MSL loading was varied from 1.5-4 mg/cm2, composition was varied from 10-50 wt.% PTFE, fabrication pressure was varied from 3.45-10.34 MPa, and fabrication time was varied from 2-8 minutes. Using these four factors, correlations were created, and optimal solutions for each response were identified. The adhesion correlation identifies a low MSL loading, mid-range MSL composition, high fabrication pressure, and high fabrication time as desirable factors. The performance correlation suggests that the PEMFC performance is enhanced with low MSL loadings, low MSL PTFE content, and a low fabrication pressure and does not find fabrication time to be a significant factor in the correlation.</div>

          <div class="list_more_link">+ Show/Hide Details</div>
          <div class="list_more">Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and
          Technology (NIST) have measured the performance of a residential fuel cell system when subjected to various environmental and load conditions. The system, which uses natural gas as its source fuel, is capable of generating electrical power at three nominal power levels (2.5 kW, 4.0 kW, and 5.0kW) while providing thermal energy for user-supplied loads. Testing was conducted to determine the influence of ambient temperature, relative humidity, electrical load, and thermal load on system performance. Steady-state and transient tests were conducted. The steady-state tests were performed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) Fuel Cell Power Systems Performance Test Code (PTC-50) for fuel cell power systems. The results of the investigation are being used to develop a proposed rating procedure for residential fuel cell units.</div>

          <div class="list_more_link">+ Show/Hide Details</div>
          <div class="list_more">This paper summarizes the monthly and annual measured performance of the photovoltaic system. The monthly energy produced by the system is tabulated. Conversion efficiencies - computed using solar radiation measurements from a single photovoltaic cell radiation sensor, four thermopile-based radiation sensors located around the perimeter of the photovoltaic array, and a remotely located thermopile-based radiation sensor, are presented. Using the electric utility’s rate schedule, the monetary savings credited to the photovoltaic system is determined by combining the cost of the displaced energy with the reduction in peak demand charges attributable to the photovoltaic system. Finally, using utility provided data and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Environ- mental Benefits Calculator, estimates are made of the avoided emissions of the photovoltaic system over its projected life span.</div>
